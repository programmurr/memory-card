# The Memory Card Game!

An Assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/memory-card)


*"The main goal of this React project is to use hooks or lifecycle methods as well as a lot of state. Make the Memory Card Game! Players should get points by clicking on an image, but they shouldn't click any card more than once! Record their current and best scores as well as 'shuffling the deck' after every click."*


## Status: In Progress

Tasks remaining:

  1. Build scoreboard which counts the current score and 'Best Score'
  2. Display 12 cards that show images or informational text
  3. Build functions that display the cards in a random order anytime a user clicks one and update scores
  4. Make proper use of useEffect and Hooks
  5. Add styling
